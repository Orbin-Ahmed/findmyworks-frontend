                        or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local

                        use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services'') and which
                        includes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad
                        services and the “Apply with Findmyworks” and “Share with Findmyworks” plugins or tags. In the
                        spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use
                        these technologies.

                                cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is
                                used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to
                                return to Findmyworks and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a
                                persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by Findmyworks when you return
                                to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies
                                last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser
                                session).

                    <h4>What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</h4>
                    <p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade
                        Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing
                        Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using
                        browser settings. As such, Findmyworks does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.
